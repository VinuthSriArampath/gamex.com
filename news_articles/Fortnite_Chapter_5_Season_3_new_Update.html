        <h1>fortnite chapter 5 season 3 update news</h1>

        <p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked is here, turning the map into a post-apocalyptic wasteland, bringing new
            POIs, Nitro abilities, weapons, vehicle mods, and more. Here's everything you need to know about Fortnite
            Chapter 5 Season 3.</p>

        <h3>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 - New POIs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Redline Rig <br><img src="/img/articles/fortnite/fortnite regline rig.webp" alt=""></li>
            <li>Nitrodome <br><img src="/img/articles/fortnite/Fortnite_Nitrodome.webp" alt=""></li>
            <li>Brutal Beachhead <br> <img src="/img/articles/fortnite/Fortnite_Brutal_Beachhead.webp" alt=""></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>New Weapons in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</h3>

        <p>There are new wasteland-themed weapons added to Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nitro fists <br> <img src="/img/articles/fortnite/Fortnite_Nitro_Fists.webp" alt=""><br>
                <p>Nitro Fists have four charges that recharge once every eight seconds and allow you to mess your
                    opponent's day up with a devastating 3x punch combo - think Doomfist from Overwatch. It also has an
                    uppercut move and you can even dash through the air with it for extra movement. The 3x punch combo
                    doesn't use any of the weapon's four charges, while the uppercut and aerial dash moves use one each.
                    You can find Nitro Fists by defeating bosses or looting chests across the island. Its Mythical
                    variant, Megalo Don's Nitro Fists, is obtained by defeating Megalo Don.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Boom Bolt <br><img src="/img/articles/fortnite/Fortnite_Boom_Bolt.webp" alt=""> <br>
                <p>The Boom Bolt is a crossbow that uses explosive bolts to deal damage. It fires fast, and is moddable
                    at a Weapon Mod Bench. While you can hit any opponent with it, it's best used to immobilize
                    vehicles, especially in areas like the Nitrodome.
                    You can find Boom Bolts across the island, though you can only find its Mythical variant,
                    Ringmaster's Boom Bolt, by defeating Ringmaster Scarr.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Machinist's Combat Assault Rifle <br><img src="/img/articles/fortnite/" alt=""> <br>The Combat
                Assault Rifle returns to Fortnite, but in the form of a new Mythic that's dropped by The Machinist in
                Redline Rig. If you like a fast fire rate and a decent bullet spread, it's worth trying to take her down
                for.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Returning Weapons From Chapter 5 Season 2</h3>

        <p>The following weapons from Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 have been unvaulted and are returning:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cerberus' Gatekeeper Shotgun</li>
            <li>Combat Shotgun</li>
            <li>Gatekeeper Shotgun</li>
            <li>Hammer Pump Shotgun</li>
            <li>Oscar's Frenzy Auto Shotgun</li>
            <li>Warforged Assault Rifle</li>
            <li>Tactical Assault Rifle</li>
            <li>Enforcer AR</li>
            <li>Thunder Burst SMG</li>
            <li>Harbinger SMG</li>
            <li>Huntress DMR</li>
            <li>Ranger Pistol</li>
            <li>Hand Cannon</li>
            <li>Shockwave Grenade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>New Vehicle - War Bus</h3>

        <p>The War Bus is a new vehicle in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3. You can't just pick one up from anywhere on the
            island, though. There are only two to be found, both driven by patrollers you must find and take out before
            you can drive the War Bus.You'll find two Cannons atop the War Bus, perfect for taking out other on-road
            enemies. It also has an EMP Pulse-producing horn that temporarily disables vehicles in its path and damages
            nearby opponents' Shields.</p>

        <h3>Vehicle Mods in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</h3>

        <p>Vehicles play a big role in Chapter 5 Season 3, and there are several vehicle mods to help you survive for
            longer while on the road.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cow Catcher - Gives the vehicle more armor and higher damage output.</li>
            <li>Chonkers Off-Road Tires - Makes the vehicle easier to handle when off-road.</li>
            <li>Machine Gun Turret - Adds a turret to the vehicle's roof that can be fired by another player in
                multiplayer matches.</li>
            <li>Grenade Launcher Turret - Adds a grenade-launching turret to the vehicle's roof.</li>
            <li>Spiked Bumper - Gives the vehicle a higher damage output.</li>
            <li>Bulletproof Tires - Stops bullets from bursting the vehicle's tires.</li>
            <p>You can also repair any damage to your vehicle using a Repair Box or Repair Torch, both found across the
                island.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>New Healing Items in Chapter 5 Season 3</h3>

        <p>Two new healing items have arrived in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3: Nuka-Cola and Kind Cacti. Yes, Nuka-Cola,
            the famous Fallout beverage, which you'll find across the island in chests and boxes.Kind Cacti isn't a
            consumable item; rather, you must find a Slurp Cactus on the island and either pickaxe it or drive into it
            with a vehicle to release its healing properties.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 5 Season 3 Battle Pass</h3>

        <p>The following wasteland-themed outfits are available to obtain via the Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 Battle Pass:</p>
